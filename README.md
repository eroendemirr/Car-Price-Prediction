# Car Price Prediction Using Polynomial Regression

This project predicts car prices based on vehicle age and brand using polynomial regression. The model is trained on a dataset containing car information and visualizes the relationship between age and price.

## Features

- One-hot encoding for categorical features (brand)
- Polynomial feature expansion (degree 4)
- Linear regression model
- Visualization of actual vs predicted prices
- Predictive capability for new input values

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
